This extensions checks for new mails on your owa account. The number of unread messages is shown at the extensions icon in chrome.
Nothing more.

User data is stored only locally on the PC where the extension is installed.
It can be deletet anytime.

I am happy for suggestions and feedback: ollidev97@mail.com ðŸ’ª

Roadmap:
 - only request permission for required domain
 - make domain permission optional
 - add option: notification for new message
